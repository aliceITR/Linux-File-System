# Linux-File-System
_Any mention of sblair3 or SB is in reference to me. Sblair 3 was the github account provided to me by the University of Wyoming. Thus, like my other programs I have moved them to this account._

This program is a file system that focuses on how to store data and how to access that data. There are files and directories that can be stored on the system as well as the ability to lock or unlock files. There are two things that are also stored for the files. Those are creator name, which is whichever user created the file, and color. The reasoning for color was to have a little fun and assign colors to files. I worked on this with 1 other person, and their github username is @gbrown15.
